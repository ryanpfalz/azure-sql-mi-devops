# Deploying an Azure SQL Managed Instance with Terraform and GitHub Actions

This sample codebase demonstrates how to deploy an Azure SQL Managed Instance with Terraform and GitHub Actions.
<br>
The motivation behind this guide is the observed lack of readily available open-source codebase examples using these technologies together.
<br>
The scenario presented in this codebase is simple and contrived - it is not intended for production use, and should be viewed as a foundation for modification and expansion into more complex applications.

## Prerequisites

- [An Azure Subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) - for hosting cloud infrastructure
- [A GitHub Account](https://github.com/join) - for deploying code via GitHub Actions

## Running this sample

### _*Setting Up the Cloud Infrastructure and Repository*_

#### App Registration

- [Register a new application](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app)
- [Create a new client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-client-secret)

#### Storage Account for Managing Remote Terraform State

- [Azure Storage will be used for storing Terraform state](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/store-state-in-azure-storage?tabs=azure-cli). In the Azure Portal, create a common resource group, and then create a storage account within it ([doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)).
- After the Storage Account is created, create a container within it to store the Terraform state files ([doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal#create-a-container)).

#### GitHub Actions Secrets & Variables

- To deploy to Azure using GitHub Actions, a handful of credentials are required for connection and configuration.

##### Secrets:

- The following credential is used to authenticate to Azure.

  1.  `AZURE_SP_CREDENTIALS`:

      - A JSON object that looks like the following will need to be populated with 4 values:

      ```
      {
      "clientId": "<GUID>",
      "clientSecret": "<STRING>",
      "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
      "tenantId": "<GUID>"
      }
      ```

      - You can find more details on creating this secret [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-login#configure-a-service-principal-with-a-secret).
      - For clientId, run: `az ad sp list --display-name <service principal name> --query '[].[appId][]' --out tsv`
      - For tenantId, run: `az ad sp show --id <clientID> --query 'appOwnerOrganizationId' --out tsv`
      - For subscriptionId, run: `az account show --query id --output tsv`
      - For clientSecret: This is the client secret created alongside the App Registration above

- The following credentials are used to set up the Azure SQL Managed Instance.

  2.  `SQL_ADMIN_USER` - Username you want to use for the SQL Server
  3.  `SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - Password you want to use for the SQL Server. Note that the password must be at least 16 characters in length and contain uppercase, lowercase, and numeric characters, and non-numeric characters, and it cannot contain part of the admin username.

      Note: All other SQL MI variables are defined in `infra/terraform/modules/module-azure-sql-mi/variables.tf`

##### Variables:

- The following credentials are used to authenticate with the storage account that stores the remote Terraform state.

  1.  `TF_REGION` - Region of the Storage Account for managing Terraform state
  2.  `TF_RESOURCE_GROUP` - Name of the resource group containing the Storage Account
  3.  `TF_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` - Name of the Storage Account for managing Terraform state
  4.  `TF_CONTAINER_NAME` - Name of the Storage Account container for managing Terraform state

#### GitHub Self-Hosted Runner

- A self-hosted runner is required because the agent must reside on the same virtual network as the SQL Managed Instance - you cannot deploy directly to a SQL Managed Instance from a GitHub-hosted runner.
- The self-hosted runner is required to run the `SQL-MI-CICD` GitHub Actions workflow. The runner can be hosted on a VM or container. For the purposes of this sample codebase, I have set up a self-hosted runner on a VM by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners). You may set up a more sophisticated runner for your setup. The steps to provision the runner are outside of the scope of this sample codebase, but I will describe how to use your runner with your SQL Managed Instance below.
  - You should consider configuring the self-hosted runner application as a service to automatically start the runner application when the machine starts, which can be done by following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service#configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service-on-windows).
- Running the self-hosted runner on the VM: Change directory to the directory containing the runner service, and start the service. For example:
  ```
  cd actions-runner
  sudo ./svc.sh start
  ```

### _*Deploying to the Cloud Infrastructure*_

1. Deploy the SQL Managed Instance with Terraform by running the `Terraform-Deploy-SQL-MI` GitHub Action. This action will take up to 30 minutes to run.
2. Once the SQL Managed Instance is deployed, you need to enable it to communicate with a self-hosted runner. You may do this either by creating a new runner in the newly created SQL MI virtual network, or by peering the SQL MI virtual network to an existing virtual network containing a self-hosted runner.

   - To peer the virtual networks, follow the steps [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks-portal) (Since both networks will already exist, you may begin at [this step](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/tutorial-connect-virtual-networks-portal#create-virtual-network-peer), and you may skip the 'Create virtual machines' step). _The address space of your SQL MI may not overlap with the address space of your self-hosted runner's network_.

     Your peering may look something like this:

3. After the virtual networks are peered, you may run the `SQL-MI-CICD` GitHub Action to deploy the sample database to the SQL Managed Instance.

## Potential Use Cases

- There are many use cases for Azure SQL Managed Instance; for example, you should consider using SQL Managed Instance when you need near 100% compatibility with the latest SQL Server database engine, want to lift and shift your applications to Azure Arc data services with minimal application and database changes, and maintain data sovereignty.
